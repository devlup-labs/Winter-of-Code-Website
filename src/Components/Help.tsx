            What programming language(s) should I know to participate in WoC?
          </AccordionSummary>
          <AccordionDetails>
            The programming language you need to know depends with which mentor
            you are interested in working with. You should be familiar with the
            programming language(s) used in that project.

          <AccordionDetails>
            While we may allow more than one student per project but it'll be
            prioritised to assign one project per person.

            Are mentors required to use the code produced by students?
          </AccordionSummary>
          <AccordionDetails>
            No. While we hope that all the code that comes out of this program
            is useful, it's not mandatory for the mentor to use students' code

          </AccordionSummary>
          <AccordionDetails>
            No. It'll not be feasible to work as both and it can hamper the
